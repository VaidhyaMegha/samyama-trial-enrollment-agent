## üéØ Project Overview

**AWS Trial Enrollment System** (frontend alias: Trial Compass Pro) is a comprehensive HIPAA-compliant clinical trial enrollment and eligibility management platform powered by AWS AI services. Our AI agent automates the complex process of matching patients to clinical trials by:

- Parsing clinical trial protocols using **AWS Bedrock with Mistral Large 2**
- Extracting and analyzing patient health data from FHIR resources via **AWS HealthLake**
- Processing protocol documents with **AWS Textract**
- Performing intelligent medical entity extraction with **AWS Comprehend Medical**
- Providing real-time recommendations and autonomous eligibility decision-making

**Real-World Impact:** Reduces trial enrollment time from weeks to minutes, potentially accelerating drug development and improving patient access to cutting-edge treatments.
