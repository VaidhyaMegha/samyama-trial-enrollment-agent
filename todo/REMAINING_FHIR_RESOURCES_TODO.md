## Temporal Criteria Support

**Note:** Many resources require temporal criteria support ("within X months", "at least Y days ago")

**Implementation Needed:**
- Date range filtering in FHIR queries
- Parser support for temporal expressions
- Date arithmetic in evaluation logic

**Effort:** 2-3 days (can be done in parallel with resource implementation)

**Priority:** üî¥ HIGH (needed for Procedure, DiagnosticReport, etc.)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Complete testing of current 6 resources
2. ‚úÖ Deploy enhanced parser with new coding systems
3. üî¥ Implement temporal criteria support (foundation for next resources)
4. üî¥ Implement Procedure resource (highest impact)

### Success Criteria for Each Resource:
- [ ] Parser prompt examples (3-5 examples with coding systems)
- [ ] FHIR search handler support
- [ ] Test patients in HealthLake (3-5 patients)
- [ ] Postman test collection (5-10 tests)
- [ ] End-to-end validation
- [ ] Documentation

### Resource Template:
Each new resource should follow this pattern:
1. Add parser prompt examples (30-60 mins)
2. Implement FHIR search function (2-4 hours)
3. Create test patients (1-2 hours)
4. Create Postman tests (1-2 hours)
5. End-to-end testing (1-2 hours)
6. Documentation (1 hour)

## Status

**Current:** 6/15 resources implemented (40%)
**Target (Phase 1):** 9/15 resources (60%)
**Target (Phase 2):** 12/15 resources (80%)
**Ultimate Goal:** 15/15 resources (100%)

**Next Action:** Implement temporal criteria support + Procedure resource
