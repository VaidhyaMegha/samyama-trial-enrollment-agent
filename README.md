## 🎯 Overview

**AWS Trial Enrollment System** is an autonomous AI agent that revolutionizes clinical trial enrollment by automating patient-trial matching. Built for the **AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon 2025**, this system reduces enrollment time from **weeks to minutes** using intelligent automation powered by **Amazon Bedrock with Mistral Large 2**.

### The Problem

**85% of clinical trials fail due to slow patient enrollment.** Traditional manual screening is:
- Time-consuming (weeks of coordinator effort)
- Error-prone (manual criteria interpretation)
- Expensive (millions in delayed drug development)
- Inconsistent (subjective eligibility decisions)

### Our Solution

An intelligent AI agent that:
- 📄 **Parses** clinical trial protocols using AWS Textract and Mistral Large 2
- 🔍 **Analyzes** patient health records from AWS HealthLake (FHIR R4)
- 🧠 **Matches** patients to trials with explainable AI reasoning
- 📊 **Generates** confidence-scored eligibility reports
