## üöÄ Executive Summary

The Clinical Trial Enrollment System is a comprehensive platform that streamlines the process of matching patients with suitable clinical trials. The system features:

- **Real-time Eligibility Checking**: Against complex trial criteria
- **Multi-role Access**: For CRCs, Study Administrators, and Principal Investigators
- **FHIR Integration**: Full support for 11 FHIR resource types
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built on AWS serverless technologies
- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with healthcare-focused UX

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Frontend**: React/TypeScript application with role-based dashboards
2. **API Gateway**: Secure entry point for all client requests
3. **Lambda Functions**: Serverless compute for business logic
4. **AWS HealthLake**: FHIR-compliant healthcare data storage
5. **DynamoDB**: For non-FHIR data and caching
6. **Amazon Cognito**: Authentication and user management
7. **AWS CDK**: Infrastructure as Code for deployment

### Data Flow
1. User authenticates via Cognito
2. Frontend makes API calls to API Gateway
3. Request passes through Lambda Authorizer
4. Business logic executes in appropriate Lambda
5. Data is stored/retrieved from HealthLake/DynamoDB
6. Response is returned to frontend

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Infrastructure

### Lambda Functions

#### Patient Manager (`TrialEnrollment-PatientManager`)
- **Endpoint**: `/patients`
- **Purpose**: Manages all patient data operations
- **Features**:
  - List/search patients from HealthLake
  - Create/update patient records
  - FHIR resource management (11 resource types)

#### FHIR Search (`TrialEnrollment-FHIRSearch`)
- **Purpose**: Eligibility criteria evaluation
- **Features**:
  - Complex criteria evaluation (AND/OR/NOT logic)
  - Recursive criteria checking
  - Performance optimization for large datasets

#### Authentication (`TrialEnrollment-Authorizer`)
- **Purpose**: JWT validation and RBAC
- **Features**:
  - Cognito JWT validation
  - Role-based access control
  - IAM policy generation

### Data Storage

#### AWS HealthLake
- **FHIR R4 Store**: `https://healthlake.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/datastore/8640ed6b344b85e4729ac42df1c7d00e/r4/`
- **Supported Resources**:
  1. Patient
  2. Condition
  3. Observation
  4. MedicationStatement
  5. Procedure
  6. And 6 more FHIR resources

#### DynamoDB Tables
1. **CriteriaCacheTable**: Stores parsed eligibility criteria
2. **EvaluationResultsTable**: Tracks eligibility evaluations
3. **MatchesTable**: Patient-protocol matches with status

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| GET | `/patients` | List patients | ‚úÖ |
| POST | `/patients` | Create patient | ‚úÖ |
| GET | `/patients/{id}` | Get patient details | ‚úÖ |
| POST | `/eligibility/check` | Check eligibility | ‚úÖ |
| POST | `/protocols` | Create protocol | ‚úÖ (Admin) |
| GET | `/protocols` | List protocols | ‚úÖ |

## üöÄ Deployment

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with admin access
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- AWS CDK v2
- Python 3.9+

### Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/trial-enrollment-system.git
   cd trial-enrollment-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
